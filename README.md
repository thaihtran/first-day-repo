# Horiseon Home Page
Home page for Horiseon code that I refactored

## Description
My goal was to use everything that I learned in week 1 to refactor the code and make it more clean to look at by using HTML semantics and cleaning up CSS without changing the end product.

Here's a link to the <a href="https://thaihtran.github.io/horiseon-page/"> landing page</a> (https://thaihtran.github.io/horiseon-page/) and a screenshot of what it should look like down here.

## Notes
Asked for assistance from a colleague in the same industry to help refactor code.
